**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain thus far this quarter has been both the overal topic of time series financial data as well as leveraging cloud computing through UCSD's own DSMLP to speed up our ML pipelines and workflows.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project?**

I would like to pursue implementing parallelized hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance in a more efficient matter and going through multiple training batches at once. Past that I want to do more in depth analyses into the features from our dataset and expand our automated feature engineering to become more robust and possibly be able to be used as a third party package.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change to our approach I would have taken in our current Quarter 1 Project would've been to use DSMLP much earlier in our project process as it would have sped up our workflow substantially as DSMLP's runtime was around 10 minutes for our entire pipeline compared to 30-40 minutes locally. Using DSMLP earlier would have accelerated our progress and allowed us to tune our model at a faster rate.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Other techniques I would be interested in would be using AWS as well to build a more concrete familiarity in its command line interface and AWS in general. Using it with our packaged code would provide a learning oppurtunity compared to my previous experience being unpackaged python files in classes. As stated earlier parallelized hyperparameter tuning and automated feature engineering command my interest going forward along with standard feature engineering which will require me to do deeper dives into the intricacies of our dataset.
